Information about deep Learning:
Why deep learning?: As the size of data increase, the performace of deep learning increases almost linearly. But usual classical ML argorithms does reach to limit quickly.
Deep Learning help automatically feature engineering (feature extraction): Deep learning handle the feature extraction and Model simulateniously. In ML project, feature exraction
and training the model are two different steps.

Complex problem can solve complicated problication such as image classification, object detection and NLP Problem

Deep Learning: ANN, CNN, RNN
First step-Neural network (first nn is Perceptron)

ANN- Forward Propogation = Z = Act(y); y =a.w + b and activation function ex is sigmoid such as (1/(1+e^-y)
Activation function: Sigmod, tanh, Relu (max(y,0))
