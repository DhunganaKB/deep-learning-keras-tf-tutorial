Information about deep Learning:
Why deep learning?: As the size of data increase, the performace of deep learning increases almost linearly. But usual classical ML argorithms does reach to limit quickly.
Deep Learning help automatically feature engineering (feature extraction): Deep learning handle the feature extraction and Model simulateniously.
Complex problem can solve complicated problication such as image classification, object detection and NLP Problem
